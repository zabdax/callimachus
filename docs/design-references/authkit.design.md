## dos
- Use 999px radius for all interactive elements (buttons, social-login buttons, tag toggles); reserve 16px radius exclusively for cards and modals, 6px for badges and inputs, and 9999px for circular icon containers.
- Build elevation from inset frost highlights + soft outer halos rather than conventional drop-shadows: pair inset rgba(216,236,248,0.2) 1px top edge with a 24-48px inset glow and a dark cool drop.
- Use Void Violet (#663af3) exclusively for the auth-form Continue/submit CTA — never as a decorative accent or non-auth button background.
- Set headline text in aeonikPro weight 500 at 44-48px with the Skywash vertical gradient (#d8ecf8 → #98c0ef); body and UI in Untitled Sans 400-500.
- Place all-caps eyebrow labels (dotDigital, 15px, 0.10em tracking, #c7d3ea) centered and flanked by fading horizontal lines at rgba(186,215,247,0.12) to mark every section opening.
- Use rgba(186,215,247,0.12) as the universal hairline border — never solid strokes; the frosted-inset edge is the system's border language.
- Set section gaps at 120px and card padding at 24px; rhythm should feel cathedral-like rather than dense SaaS.
- Render text in the Ice Highlight → Frost Glow → Moon Mist → Fog Veil progression (#d8ecf8 → #d1e4fa → #c7d3ea → #9da7ba) for heading → body → muted body → helper copy.
- Use the conic-gradient spotlight halo (rgba(124,145,182,0.5) at center, fading outward) at the top of every full-bleed hero to anchor the composition.

## donts
- Do not introduce additional chromatic accents — the palette is monochromatic with one violet CTA; any extra hue breaks the system.
- Do not use solid colored borders; replace them with 1px inset rgba(186,215,247,0.12) strokes to preserve the glass aesthetic.
- Do not use bold weights (600+) on aeonikPro display headings — the wordmark's authority comes from weight 500 at large size, not volume.
- Do not apply conventional drop-shadows; the system reads elevation through inset glow + dark halo.
- Do not mix radius families on the same component type — every button is pill, every card is 16px, every badge is 6px.
- Do not place white (#ffffff) on background tints brighter than rgba(186,214,247,0.12) — the contrast floor collapses.
- Do not use the Skywash gradient on body text or buttons; reserve it for the display wordmark and the largest headings only.
- Do not introduce light-theme colors into core tokens even though the product supports light mode; the marketing site is dark-first, and light-mode demos are a product feature, not a design-system palette.

## layout
Full-bleed dark canvas, max-width 1200px content container centered. Hero is a single centered illuminated wordmark ('AuthKit' in gradient display type) under a small eyebrow label, with three floating glass auth-form cards layered behind/below in an overlapping fan (left card tilted left, center card scaled largest, right card tilted right). Below the hero, a light/dark theme toggle sits centered. Feature row is a horizontal 6-icon timeline with thin connecting lines between circular icon tiles. Section rhythm: every section opens with a centered eyebrow label flanked by fading horizontal lines, then a large centered heading (44-48px), then a single line of muted body copy (16-18px), max ~640px width. Customization section features a mock browser-window frame with the auth card centered, surrounded by floating UI inspector panels (color swatches, radius sliders, logo icon picker, button text field, page background field) positioned at the corners of the canvas like a design-tool workspace.

## imagery
Visuals are dominated by glass-morphism auth-form mockups (email/password inputs, social-login buttons, passwordless code-entry) rendered as floating translucent cards against the midnight canvas. Feature icons are line-art mono glyphs in #d1e4fa inside circular frosted tiles. A faint blueprint grid (1px lines at rgba(186,215,247,0.06)) covers the full page as ambient atmosphere, and a conic-gradient spotlight halo glows at the top of the hero. No photography, no lifestyle imagery, no product screenshots — the product IS the visual: login boxes arranged like glass prototypes in a dark studio.

## description
AuthKit renders a midnight product-launch aesthetic: a near-black canvas with frosted-glass surfaces, a grid of faint blueprint lines, and luminous text that appears lit from behind a glass layer. Type is almost entirely white-on-dark with one vivid violet as the single functional accent — every interactive surface wears a soft inset hairline of cool blue-white rather than a hard border. Components sit on translucent layers stacked above ambient glows, with cards that look like glass plates lit from below rather than paper panels. Spacing is generous and rhythmic; the hero is a single full-bleed illuminated wordmark surrounded by floating glass cards rather than a conventional split layout.

## elevationPhilosophy
Elevation is built entirely from inset frost highlights and soft outer halos rather than conventional drop-shadows. Cards appear lit from inside their own glass — bright top edges, soft mid-glow, and a dark cool shadow below — producing depth without weight.
