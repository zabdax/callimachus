# Your workplace has the answer. Just ask Dala for it. (https://dala.craftedbygc.com)

## dos
- Use #8052ff (Electric Iris) exclusively for filled action buttons — no other saturated color should appear as a button background
- Set every headline at weight 400, never bold — Dala achieves hierarchy through scale (78–113px) and tracking (-0.04em), not font weight
- Use PPNeueMontreal weight 200 for 18px body text — the ultra-light weight is a signature, do not substitute weight 400
- Maintain pure #000000 black as every section background — never use dark gray panels or card surfaces; the void is the design
- Apply -0.04em letter-spacing on all display sizes 42px and above, converting to approximately -4.52px at 113px
- Use 24px border-radius for buttons, cards, and nav elements as the consistent radius token — pill shapes only at very small sizes
- Let the particle constellation be the only hero imagery — do not introduce photography, illustrations, or product screenshots into the hero region

## donts
- Do not use filled violet (#8052ff) for large background blocks or full sections — it is a button and accent color, not a surface
- Do not set body text at weight 400 — Dala's signature ultra-light (200) body copy is what distinguishes the reading experience
- Do not introduce card containers with borders, shadows, or background fills — elements float on black with whitespace alone
- Do not use color #0000ee (default browser link blue) — never specify it; use #ffb829 amber or #ffffff for links
- Do not add gradients to UI components — Dala's palette is flat; gradients belong only in the logo and the particle visualization
- Do not use system fonts as substitutes when PPNeueMontreal-equivalent geometry matters — use Inter as fallback but preserve the weight 200 body and weight 400 headline convention
- Do not place multiple filled buttons in proximity — the violet pill is reserved for singular primary actions per view

## layout
Full-bleed sections on pure black canvas, max content width ~1280px centered. Hero is a two-column asymmetric split: oversized left-aligned headline (113px) with body copy and CTA on the left half, particle brain visualization occupying the right half at massive scale. Subsequent sections alternate the two-column composition (visual-left/text-right, then text-left/visual-right) creating a zigzag reading rhythm. Section gaps are generous (60–120px vertical). No card grids, no pricing tables, no multi-column feature blocks — content lives in spacious two-column text+visual arrangements. Navigation is a minimal transparent top bar, no sidebar, no mega-menu. Density is extremely spacious — one or two elements per viewport, never information-dense.

## imagery
Imagery is entirely procedural and abstract — no photography except team portraits. The signature visual is a dense cloud of thousands of tiny outlined triangular particles in a full vivid spectrum (violets, ambers, teals, magentas, blues) forming an organic brain/neural shape. This particle field is animated and acts as both hero art and brand identity. Surrounding ambient particles drift at lower density across the page background. Triangles are outlined, 1–2px stroke, sharp-edged, in saturated chromatic colors — never grayscale. Team portraits appear as large rounded-rectangle crops (24px radius) without frames or overlays. No product screenshots, no lifestyle photography, no 3D renders — the particle system IS the visual brand.

Weight 600 at 14px with 0.025em tracking and uppercase serves nav and small labels. The number 400 doing both 113px display and 15px body is unusual — it means the brand trusts scale, not weight, for hierarchy.","sizes":"12, 14, 15, 18, 24, 27, 36, 42, 48, 78, 113px","family":"PPNeueMontreal","weight":"200, 400, 600, 700","lineHeight":"0.81, 0.90, 1.00, 1.10, 1.20, 1.25, 1.30, 1.50","substitute":"Inter","letterSpacing":"-4.52px at 113px, -3.12px at 78px, -1.68px at 42px, -0.48px at 24px, normal at 18px body; 0.025em at 14px uppercase nav","fontFeatureSettings":"\"ss01\" on"}

## description
Dala operates as a dark-stage environment where black voids meet a single vivid violet accent, punctuated by amber sparks. Typography is monolithic and weightless — PPNeueMontreal at weight 400 dominates every heading at outsized scales (78–113px) with aggressive negative tracking, so headlines feel sculptural rather than informational. The visual centerpiece is a constellation of tiny multicolored triangular particles forming an organic brain shape, which acts as the brand's signature gesture: knowledge visualized as distributed intelligence rather than hierarchical data. Layout follows a spacious two-column rhythm — oversized left-aligned headlines paired with generous body copy, floating on pure black with no panels, borders, or cards. Components are intentionally reduced to their most essential form: one violet pill button, ghost text links, and large-format text blocks.

## elevationPhilosophy
Dala uses no shadows or elevation. All hierarchy is achieved through scale, color contrast, and whitespace on a flat black canvas. The absence of cards-with-shadows is deliberate — the void is the design, and any shadow would break the floating-in-space quality of the typography and particle constellation.
