# Huly (https://huly.io)

## dos
- Use 9999px radius for all buttons, tags, and pill controls — pill geometry is the system's signature shape
- Reserve Esbuild for display moments (28px and up); never use it for body, nav, or anything below 22px
- Pick a background mode first: dark (#303236 canvas) for product-heavy screens, white (#ffffff) for editorial sections — never blend them in one component
- Use Electric Iris (#5683da) for the single most important action per screen; let Ember Pulse (#ff8964) appear as warm punctuation in tags, dots, and gradient stops
- Apply the aurora gradient (iris → ember → white) as a narrow vertical or radial beam, never as a full background fill
- Set body text to 14px / line-height 1.5 / -0.14px tracking, and increase tracking compression proportionally with size (to -4px at 80px display)
- Stack dark and light sections as alternating bands with 96px vertical gaps to create the page's signature rhythm

## donts
- Don't use sharp corners (0–8px) on buttons or tags — the system is pill-first
- Don't pair Inter display weights with the custom Esbuild; they fight each other at large sizes
- Don't apply the aurora gradient as a full-surface background — it loses its impact when it covers everything
- Don't introduce a third accent color; the iris/ember pair is the entire chromatic vocabulary
- Don't use shadows for elevation on dark cards — the system prefers borders (#4a4b50) and color contrast over drop shadows
- Don't use Esbuild below 28px or in body copy — it was designed for headlines, and its tight tracking crushes readability at small sizes
- Don't put white text on a white section, or #303236 text on the dark canvas without checking contrast — the dark palette has narrow readable bands

## layout
Full-bleed hero with a vertical aurora beam and headline left-aligned, product screenshot floating bottom-right. Below the hero, a max-width 1200px content area alternates dark and light bands. Each section is a single vertical block: heading + 3-column or 4-column card grid, separated by 96px gaps. The 'MetaBrain' section breaks the grid with a centered display heading and a mixed-size card mosaic (large featured card + smaller supporting cards). The page is content-dense by SaaS standards but uses the dark/light band alternation to give each section room to breathe. Navigation is a single transparent top bar that becomes opaque on scroll.

## imagery
Hero is pure aurora gradient — no photography. All feature illustrations are real product UI screenshots (dark-mode kanban, inbox, calendar) wrapped in card frames, functioning as both evidence and decoration. No lifestyle photography, no stock imagery, no 3D renders. The only non-UI visual element is the warm radial sunburst glow at the base of the aurora, painted as a CSS gradient. Icons are monochrome line icons in #95979 or white, never multicolor. The system treats its own dark UI as the hero asset — the product is the photography.

## northStar
Aurora through a midnight observatory — the hero is a vertical beam of violet melting into coral, and every quiet section below it borrows that same two-color story told at lower volume.

## description
Huly projects a cosmic-workspace atmosphere: near-black canvas with a single violet-to-amber aurora slicing through the hero, then a quieter productivity grid below. The system lives in a narrow chromatic band — one electric iris blue and one ember coral do all the brand work against layered graphite surfaces, so the dark mode never feels neutral. Typography is Inter for everything functional, with a custom display face (Esbuild) reserved for hero moments at 80–84px with aggressive negative tracking. Components lean pill-shaped: 9999px radii on controls, 12px on cards, minimal shadow, and glowing gradient strokes as the primary decoration. The page alternates between full-bleed dark spectacle and calm light sections, so any new screen must decide which mode it's in before picking colors.
